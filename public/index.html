          <p>To jumpstart the first developmental stage of the Ocean Archive, TBA21–Academy presents <strong><em>Phenomenal Ocean</em>, a day of ideas for a new ocean language, curated by Chus Martínez,</strong> Expedition Leader of the second cycle of TBA21–Academy's fellowship programme the Current. The public gathering, taking place at Ocean Space - a collective embassy for the Oceans in Venice, will be structured as a series of interviews with experts, scientists, artists, musicians, and activists discussing the tools we need to perform better for a living ocean.</p>
          <p><em>Phenomenal Ocean</em> is prompted by the release of the forthcoming Special Report on the Oceans and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, to be issued by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  As part of the response to the upcoming report, Ocean Archive invited arts and culture organizations worldwide to participate in a network of autonomous events to be held on the same day. By supporting local initiatives for ocean conservation and protection, these partner events will create spaces to gather a community around shared concerns and collective actions, advocating for <strong>climate justice for a living ocean.</strong> </p>
          <p><em>&#8220;To this process belongs not only action and a sense of urgency, but also philosophy, art, and defining culture, so that it encompasses scientific thinking and analysis, political thought, community concerns, and justice in all its complex forms.</em></p>
          <p><em>Performing is a better word that doing. Performing includes the body, and it includes the Ocean itself as a performer.&#8221;</em></p>

                  The Ocean Archive is a platform operating at the intersection of scientific inquiry, artistic intelligence, and environmental advocacy; it will launch on September 28, 2019.

                    <li>
                      Host and produce material by a
                      multiplicity of voices to share
                      human and non-human stories of
                      the ocean across various media;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Render visible and discoverable a
                      range of disciplinary perspectives
                      and connect individuals, groups, and
                      institutions committed to a living

          <p>You may assert the following rights regarding the data processing described:</p>
          <p>5.1 Right to information</p>
          <p>You may request confirmation of whether and to what extent your personal data are being processed.</p>
          <p>5.2 Right to correction</p>
          <p>If we are processing incomplete or incorrect personal data about you, then you may request that they be corrected or supplemented.</p>
          <p>5.3 Right to deletion</p>
          <p>You may request the deletion of your personal data as long as the purpose for which they were collected has ceased to apply, the processing is unlawful, the processing disproportionately interferes with your legitimate interests in protection or the data processing is based on your consent and you have withdrawn this. In this regard, it is necessary to consider that there may be other reasons that may prevent immediate deletion of your data e.g. legally regulated retention requirements, pending proceedings, asserting, exercising or defending legal claims etc. </p>
          <p>5.4 Right to restricted processing </p>
          <p>You have the right to request that processing of your data be restricted if</p>
          <ul>
            <li>you dispute the accuracy of your data, namely for a period which enables us to review the accuracy of the data,</li>
            <li>the processing of your data is unlawful, but you reject deletion and instead request that use of the data be restricted,</li>
            <li>we no longer need the data for the envisaged purpose, but you still require this data to assert, exercise or defend legal claims, or</li>
            <li>you have objected to the processing of the data.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>5.5 Right to data portability </p>
          <p>You may ask us to provide your data, which you have made available to us, in a structured, common and machine-readable format, provided we are processing the data on the basis of your consent or in order to satisfy a contract between us and processing occurs with the help of an automatic process.</p>
          <p>5.6 Right to object </p>
          <p>If we process your data in order to perform tasks that are in the public interest, to exercise official authority or, when processing the data, we invoke the necessity of safeguarding our legitimate interest, you can object to this data processing provided there is a predominant interest in the protection of your data. At any time, you may object without providing grounds to the sending of advertising.</p>
          <p>5.7 Right to complain</p>
          <p>If you think we have breached Austrian or European data protection law when processing your data and have violated your rights as a result, we ask that you contact us in order to be able to clarify any questions. Of course, you also have the right to complain to the Austrian data protection authority or a European supervisory authority. </p>
          <p>5.8 Right to withdraw</p>
          <p>All the declarations of consent you have given may be withdrawn independently from one another at any time. The result of withdrawal is that, from this date, we will no longer process the data for the purposes specified in the declaration of consent and, consequently, that the corresponding rights, benefits etc. can no longer to used.</p>
